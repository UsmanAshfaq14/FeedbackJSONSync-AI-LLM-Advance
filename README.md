# FeedbackJSONSync-AI Case Study

## Overview

**FeedbackJSONSync-AI** is an intelligent system designed to translate and synchronize multilingual customer feedback from noisy social media data into a structured JSON format. Its purpose is to help organizations extract actionable insights and conduct sentiment analysis by converting unstructured social media feedback into a standardized, machine-readable format. The system explains every step—from data validation to translation and sentiment calculations—in clear, simple language, making it accessible even to non-technical users.

## Metadata

- **Project Name:** FeedbackJSONSync-AI  
- **Version:** 1.0.0  
- **Author:** Feedback Team  
- **Keywords:** Customer Feedback, Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Data Validation, JSON Conversion

## Features

- **Data Validation:**  
  The system rigorously checks the input data to ensure it meets required standards. It accepts data in CSV or JSON formats and verifies that every record includes all required fields:
  - `feedback_id`
  - `language`
  - `feedback_text`
  - `sentiment_score` (if provided, must be a number between -1 and 1)
  - `timestamp` (in ISO 8601 format)
  
  If any field is missing or contains an invalid value, a detailed Data Validation Report is generated so the user can correct the errors.

- **Step-by-Step Processing:**  
  For each feedback record, the system:
  - **Translation Check:**  
    If the feedback is not in English, it translates the text into English.
  - **Sentiment Analysis Calculation:**  
    It calculates the sentiment score using a simple formula by counting the occurrence of positive and negative words in the feedback text. The formula used is:
    $$
    \text{sentiment\_score} = \frac{(P - N)}{\text{total\_words}}
    $$
    where *P* is the count of positive words and *N* is the count of negative words.
  - **Timestamp Synchronization:**  
    It ensures that the timestamp is standardized (UTC) if necessary.
  - **JSON Conversion:**  
    After processing, the data is transformed into a structured JSON format that is easy to use for further analysis.

- **User Interaction and Feedback:**  
  The system interacts with the user through a clear conversation flow:
  - It greets the user and offers data input templates.
  - It validates the provided data, returning error messages when necessary.
  - It confirms with the user before proceeding with further analysis.
  - It finally provides a detailed report with all processing steps and results.

>   }
>  ]
> }
> ```
> 
> **DATA INPUT VALIDATION**  
> For each record, validate that all required fields are present and correct. If any field is missing or invalid, return an error message indicating the problematic field(s) and row number. After validation, output a Data Validation Report in markdown format.
> 
> **TRANSLATION AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**  
> For each feedback record, if the language is not "en", translate the feedback text into English. If the sentiment score is not provided, calculate it using the formula:
> 
> $$
> \text{sentiment\_score} = \frac{(P - N)}{\text{total\_words}}
> $$
> 
> where *P* is the count of positive words and *N* is the count of negative words. Round the result to 2 decimal places.
> 
> **CONVERSION LOGIC**  
> Convert the validated and processed data into the structured JSON format.
> 
> **RESPONSE STRUCTURE**  
> The final output is provided in markdown format with clearly defined sections for data summary, detailed analysis, and final structured JSON output.
> 
> **ERROR HANDLING**  
> In case of errors, provide detailed error messages and a Data Validation Report for the user to correct the input.

## Variations and Test Flows

### Flow 1: JSON Data with Missing Field Error
- **User Action:**  
  The user greets and immediately provides JSON data containing 10 feedback records. One record is missing a required field (e.g., `timestamp` in row 3).
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system analyzes the input and generates a Data Validation Report that indicates the missing `timestamp` in row 3:
  ```markdown
  # Customer Feedback Data Validation Report:
  - Total Feedback Records: 10

  ## Required Fields Check:
  - feedback_id: present
  - language: valid
  - feedback_text: valid
  - sentiment_score: valid
  - timestamp: missing in row 3

  ## Validation Status:
  ERROR: Missing required field(s): timestamp in row 3. Please correct and resubmit.
  ```

### Flow 2: Requesting the Template
- **User Action:**  
  After receiving the error report, the user asks for the data input template.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system provides both the CSV and JSON templates to guide the user in preparing the correct data.

### Flow 3: Correct Data Submission
- **User Action:**  
  The user submits the corrected JSON data with all 10 feedback records properly filled.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system validates the data and produces a Data Validation Report confirming that all fields are correct:
  ```markdown
  # Customer Feedback Data Validation Report:
  - Total Feedback Records: 10

  ## Required Fields Check:
  - feedback_id: present
  - language: valid
  - feedback_text: valid
  - sentiment_score: valid
  - timestamp: valid

  ## Validation Status:
  Data validation is successful! Would you like to proceed with the analysis or provide another dataset?
  ```

### Flow 4: Proceeding with Analysis and Final Report
- **User Action:**  
  The user agrees to proceed with the analysis.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system processes each feedback record by performing translation (if necessary), calculating sentiment scores (using the formula provided), synchronizing timestamps, and finally converting the processed data into structured JSON format.  
  A detailed final report is generated, including:
  - A summary of total records processed.
  - A per-feedback breakdown showing:
    - Input data details.
    - Step-by-step processing steps (translation, sentiment analysis, and timestamp synchronization).
    - Final structured JSON output.
  
  The final report clearly explains every calculation and decision in simple language.

## Final Report Example (Flow 4 Summary)

Below is a summary of the final report generated during Flow 4:

---

**Cloud Resource Allocation Summary for Customer Feedback:**

- **Total Feedback Records Evaluated:** 10

**Detailed Analysis per Feedback (Example Record):**

**Feedback: FB601**  
*Input Data:*  
- **Language:** en  
- **Feedback-Text:** "The new interface is good and intuitive"  
- **Sentiment Score:** Not provided  
- **Timestamp:** "2023-03-21T08:00:00Z"

*Processing Steps:*  
1. **Translation Check:**  
   - Since the language is "en", the original text is used.
2. **Sentiment Analysis Calculation:**  
   - Positive words identified: "good" (P = 1)  
   - Negative words identified: None (N = 0)  
   - Total words in the feedback: 7  
   - Calculation:  
     $$
     \text{sentiment\_score} = \frac{1 - 0}{7} \approx 0.14
     $$
3. **Timestamp Synchronization:**  
   - The provided timestamp "2023-03-21T08:00:00Z" is used as-is.

*Final Structured JSON Output (Excerpt):*
```json
{
 "feedbacks": [
  {
   "feedback_id": "FB601",
   "language": "en",
   "feedback_text": "The new interface is good and intuitive",
   "sentiment_score": 0.14,
   "timestamp": "2023-03-21T08:00:00Z"
  },
  ...
 ]
}
```

Each feedback record is processed similarly with clear, step-by-step calculations and validations.
